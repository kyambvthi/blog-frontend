## blog frontend

blog frontend written using HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla javascript

## why ?
worked on a [fork](https://github.com/kyambvthi/news-blog-frontend/tree/responsive-homepage) then thought it should be a standalone repo.

very confusing, everything

## challenge
learn and implement standard best practices using only the bare bone tech

- no frameworks, vanilla javascript only
- modular, readable, maintainable CSS3
- clear and concise HTML5 markup

there should be a way to deploy this but the focus here is on writing easily readable/maintainable code
